      <h1>Terms of Use (Chess Timer)</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last updated: January 2, 2026</p>
      <p>
        These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Chess Timer mobile application (“App”).
        By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>License and allowed use</h2>
      <p>
        We give you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your own lawful
        purposes and only as permitted by these Terms and applicable laws.
      </p>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>reverse engineer, copy, or resell the App</li>
        <li>misuse the App, interfere with its operation, or try to bypass security</li>
        <li>use the App in any unlawful way</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ownership</h2>
      <p>
        The App and all related rights (including code, design, and branding) are owned by us or our licensors.
        These Terms do not transfer ownership to you.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Subscriptions and billing (Apple)</h2>
      <p>
        Some features require a paid subscription purchased through Apple In-App Purchase. Subscriptions renew
        automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Payment is charged to
        your Apple ID at confirmation of purchase. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID account
        settings (App Store). If a free trial is offered, any unused portion is forfeited when you purchase a
        subscription. Prices vary by region and are shown in the App Store before purchase. Refund requests are handled
        by Apple under its refund policy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Updates and availability</h2>
      <p>
        We may change, update, suspend, or discontinue the App (or parts of it) at any time. The App may not always be
        available and may contain bugs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>No warranties</h2>
      <p>
        The App is provided “as is” and “as available”. To the maximum extent allowed by law, we disclaim all
        warranties, including fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Safety and tournament use</h2>
      <p>
        The App is a general chess clock tool. We do not guarantee it meets any specific tournament or federation
        requirements. You are responsible for confirming rules and settings for your event.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent allowed by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
        or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profit, or revenue. Our total liability for any claim related to the
        App will not exceed the amount you paid to use the App (if any) during the 12 months before the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so parts of this section may not apply to you.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your access to the App if you materially violate these Terms. You may stop using
        the App at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-party services</h2>
      <p>

      <p>
        We may update these Terms. If we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date. Continued use of the
        App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
