PRIVACY POLICY

Last Updated: 11 February 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Maksym Farynets ("we," "us," "our") handles information in connection with the Imposter word guessing party game iOS app (the "App") and related services (collectively, the "Services").

If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, do not use the Services.

1. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to information processed through the App and our support communications (for example, support@appside.io).

1.1 Current data handling model

As of the Last Updated date above, we do not maintain user accounts or server-side personal profiles for in-app gameplay activity. Gameplay data is processed primarily on-device. We may receive personal information only when you contact support and limited subscription/entitlement metadata from Apple or related service integrations.

2. Information We Collect

2.1 Information you provide directly

We may collect information you provide when you contact us, such as:
- name
- email address
- message content
- attachments, screenshots, or other files you send us

2.2 Gameplay and app-use information

The App may process gameplay inputs (such as player names and game settings) to provide core functionality. Gameplay information may be stored locally on your device and is not intended to be uploaded to our servers as user profiles.

2.3 Diagnostics and analytics information

As of the Last Updated date above, we do not run third-party analytics SDKs in the App beyond Apple-provided platform analytics/diagnostics controls.

If this changes, we will update this Privacy Policy and Annex A before or when the change takes effect.

2.4 Subscription and purchase information

Subscriptions and payments are processed by Apple. We do not receive your full payment card details.

We may receive limited subscription-related data from Apple and/or our service providers, such as:
- subscription status
- product or plan identifier
- transaction metadata needed to validate entitlements

2.5 Information collected by third parties

If you use third-party services through your device (for example, sharing through the iOS share sheet), those third parties process information under their own terms and privacy policies.

3. How We Use Information

We use information to:
- provide, operate, and maintain the Services
- enable subscriptions and premium features
- troubleshoot issues and improve performance
- respond to support requests
- detect abuse, fraud, security, and technical incidents
- comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms

4. How We Share Information

We may share information:
- with Apple, for App Store purchase and subscription operations
- with service providers that perform services for us (for example, infrastructure, diagnostics, and customer support tooling)
- when required by law, legal process, or valid government request
- to protect rights, safety, and security of users, us, or others
- in connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, sale of assets, or similar transaction

Where we use service providers, we require them to handle personal information only for authorized purposes and to use appropriate confidentiality and security protections. If we add third-party analytics or tracking providers, we will list them in Annex A.

We do not sell personal information for money.

As of the Last Updated date above, we do not share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.

5. Data Retention

We keep information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to:
- provide the Services
- comply with legal, tax, accounting, and regulatory obligations
- resolve disputes
- enforce agreements

Retention periods vary by data type and context. When data is no longer needed, we delete it or de-identify it, unless legal obligations require longer retention.

6. Data Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is fully secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

7. Your Choices and Rights

Depending on where you live, you may have rights regarding your personal information, such as:
- access
- correction
- deletion
- portability
- objection or restriction (where applicable)
- non-discrimination for exercising privacy rights

To exercise rights, contact support@appside.io. We may need to verify your request before processing it. You may also authorize an agent where applicable law allows.

Because we do not maintain user accounts or persistent server-side user profiles for gameplay, we may not always be able to identify you from the information we hold. In those cases, we may request additional information needed to verify your request and may be unable to fulfill certain requests if we cannot reasonably verify identity, subject to applicable law.

Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawal does not affect lawful processing that occurred before withdrawal.

If you no longer want local app data on your device, you can remove the App from your device and clear local data through iOS settings where available.

7.1 California disclosures

If you are a California resident, you may have rights under California privacy laws, including rights to know, delete, correct, and access specific information about how your data is handled, subject to legal exceptions.

We do not currently sell personal information or share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.

7.2 Do Not Track

Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" (DNT) signal. Because there is no single agreed standard for DNT signal interpretation, the App does not currently respond to DNT signals.

8. Children's Privacy

The Services are not intended for children below the minimum age shown for the App on the local App Store product page. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children in violation of applicable law.

If you believe a child has provided personal information in violation of applicable law, contact support@appside.io and we will take appropriate steps.

9. International Data Transfers

We and our service providers may process information in countries other than your own. Where required by law, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.

10. Third-Party Services

The Services may link to or rely on third-party services that we do not control. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.

11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the "Last Updated" date above and may provide additional notice where required by law.

12. Contact Us

If you have questions or requests about this Privacy Policy, contact:

Email: support@appside.io

13. Annex A - Third-Party Analytics and Tracking Providers

As of the Last Updated date above, no third-party analytics or advertising SDK providers are enabled by us in the App.

If we enable any such provider in the future, we will update this Annex to identify:
- provider name
- purpose of processing
- categories of data involved
- provider privacy policy link
- effective date of use
