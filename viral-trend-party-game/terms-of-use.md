Last Updated: 11 February 2026

These Terms of Use and End User License Agreement (the “Terms”) are a legally binding agreement between you (“you,” “your,” “User”) and Maksym Farynets (“Owner,” “we,” “us,” “our”).

These Terms govern your access to and use of the iOS mobile application (the “Application”) and any related features and content (collectively, the “Services”).

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services and uninstall the Application.

IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE

The Services are provided “as is” and “as available,” and these Terms contain limitations of liability and indemnification obligations that may significantly affect your rights.

Changes are effective when posted, unless a later effective date is stated. If we make material changes, we will provide notice where required by applicable law. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of an updated version constitutes acceptance, subject to applicable law.

6. Regional Availability

The Services are offered only in locations where we choose to make them available. Availability may vary by country or region, and we may limit or refuse access to the Services in any location at any time. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services is lawful where you live and where you use them. Nothing in these Terms limits any consumer rights that cannot be waived under applicable law.

- We do not supervise, control, or organize in-person gameplay.
- You are solely responsible for your conduct and the conduct of anyone you invite to participate.
- Do not use the Services while driving, cycling in traffic, operating machinery, cooking, or in any situation where distraction could cause harm.
- You are responsible for complying with applicable laws and venue rules.

You are responsible for participating safely and using reasonable judgment during gameplay. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for harms caused by participants’ real-world conduct, venue conditions, or third-party acts outside our reasonable control. Nothing in these Terms limits any liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law.

8. No Professional Advice

The Services do not provide legal, medical, safety, or other professional advice. You are responsible for using your judgment and acting safely.

9. License Grant

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download and use the Application on iOS devices you own or control, as permitted by Apple’s App Store terms and rules, for personal use and permitted creator use.


All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved.

- access the Services through automated means (bots, scraping) or interfere with service stability
- resell, rent, lease, sublicense, or otherwise exploit the Services as a stand-alone commercial product or service without our written consent

For clarity, we permit you to share gameplay screenshots and videos (including livestreams and recorded creator content) so long as your use complies with these Terms and applicable law.

11. Player Names and No Verification

The Application may allow entry of player names for gameplay reference. Player names:

- may be fictional or random
- are not verified by us
- do not represent identity confirmation or endorsement by us

You are responsible for any names you choose to use and for ensuring they do not violate applicable law or the rights of others. You must not use player names to impersonate others or to harass, threaten, or defame any person.
Player names are provided for gameplay convenience only. We do not independently verify or moderate player names, and any collection or storage of names is described in our Privacy Policy.

12. Sharing

The Application may include a “Share” feature that opens the standard iOS share sheet. We do not control what you share or the third-party apps or services you use to share it. Your sharing activity may be subject to third-party terms and policies. Do not share personal data of others without an appropriate legal basis or consent, as required by applicable law.

13. Subscriptions, Free Trials, Billing, Cancellation, and Refunds

13.1 Purchases through Apple
Subscriptions are purchased through the Apple App Store. Apple processes payments and controls billing and refunds according to Apple’s terms.

13.2 Plans and Premium Features
We may offer weekly, monthly, and yearly Subscription plans. An active Subscription unlocks Premium Features, including premium functionality and Word Packs. The specific Premium Features available may change over time.

13.3 Free Trials
A Free Trial or introductory offer may be offered for certain users or plans, but is not guaranteed and may be withdrawn at any time. Eligibility for trials or introductory offers is determined under Apple’s rules and your App Store account status, together with any offer configuration we choose to make available. If a Free Trial is offered, it will convert to a paid Subscription unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the trial ends.

13.4 Auto-renewal and renewal charges
Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. Your Apple ID account may be charged within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

13.5 How to cancel
You must manage and cancel Subscriptions through your Apple ID account settings. On iOS, this is typically available under Settings > [your name] > Subscriptions. Uninstalling the Application does not cancel your Subscription.

13.6 Pricing and plan changes
We may change Subscription pricing, plans, or the Services as permitted by applicable law and Apple rules. Where required, we will provide advance notice. If you do not agree to a change that applies to you, you must cancel before it takes effect.

13.7 Refunds
Refund requests must be submitted to Apple. We do not process or override Apple refund decisions. Nothing in these Terms limits any statutory rights you may have under applicable law.

13.8 No future commitments
We may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services at any time. A Subscription purchase is not a promise of future functionality or content. Word Packs and Premium Features may be added, removed, rotated, or replaced over time. For purposes of these Terms, a “material removal” means a change that substantially reduces the core paid functionality of your current Subscription, such as paid access to premium word packs or premium gameplay settings. If we materially remove paid Premium Features during your current billing period, we will provide any access, replacement, or other remedy required by applicable law.

13.9 Restore purchases and Family Sharing
You can restore eligible purchases using Apple mechanisms linked to your Apple ID, such as using any in-app “Restore Purchases” control (if available) and/or your Apple ID purchase history. Apple controls restoration mechanics and entitlement decisions. Family Sharing availability for Subscriptions is determined by Apple and the setting shown on the App Store product page for the Subscription; it may not be available for all plans or in all regions.

13.10 EEA/UK digital content consumer rights
If you are a consumer in the EEA or UK, you may have mandatory legal rights regarding digital content and digital services, including rights that the Services conform to contract requirements and rights to remedies where they do not. Depending on applicable law, those remedies may include bringing the Services into conformity, a price reduction, or termination. Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits those mandatory rights.

14. Availability, Compatibility, Updates, Interruptions, and Data Loss

The Services may experience interruptions, downtime, delays, or errors. We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability or compatibility with all devices or iOS versions.

We may provide updates, patches, or changes. Some updates may be required to continue using the Services.

Service interruptions and external causes. Outages or issues may occur due to maintenance, upgrades, network conditions, device performance, third-party service failures, cyber incidents, or events beyond our reasonable control.

Data loss. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for any loss, corruption, or unavailability of data or settings, whether caused by the Services, your device, Apple, or third parties. You are responsible for maintaining access to your device and Apple ID and for protecting your device (including using passcodes and keeping your iOS updated).

15. Intellectual Property

The Services, including software, design, Word Packs, content, and branding, are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by applicable laws. You do not acquire any ownership rights.

Any third-party names or trademarks, if any appear in the Services, are the property of their respective owners.
References to third-party names, trademarks, brands, or public figures (if any) are for gameplay and descriptive purposes only and do not imply affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement.

16. Feedback

If you submit ideas, suggestions, or feedback about the Services (collectively, “Feedback”), you agree that:

- Feedback is provided voluntarily and without expectation of compensation.
- We may use, copy, modify, publish, distribute, and commercialize the Feedback for any purpose, without restriction or obligation to you.
- To the extent permitted by law, you assign to us any rights you may have in the Feedback.

17. Disclaimers

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or meet your expectations.

Nothing in these Terms limits any statutory rights you may have under applicable law.

18. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- We are not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or business opportunities.
- We are not liable for harm arising from in-person gameplay or real-world conduct of Users or Participants.

To the extent liability is not excluded, our total liability for all claims relating to the Services will not exceed the amounts you paid for the Services for the current billing period in effect when the event giving rise to the claim occurred.

Nothing in these Terms limits liability that cannot be limited under applicable law, including liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or for fraud. This limitation does not apply where prohibited by law and does not affect any rights that cannot be waived. If you are a consumer, nothing in this Section 18 limits any non-waivable consumer rights under the law of your habitual residence.

19. Indemnification

To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) to the extent caused by:

- your use or misuse of the Services
- your violation of these Terms or applicable law
- your conduct during gameplay or participation you facilitate

Nothing in these Terms limits any statutory rights you may have under applicable law. If you are a consumer, nothing in this Section 19 limits any non-waivable consumer rights under the law of your habitual residence.

20. Suspension and Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services if we reasonably believe you violated these Terms, created risk, or used the Services unlawfully. Upon termination, the license granted to you ends and you must stop using the Application.

Termination does not automatically cancel a Subscription. You must cancel through Apple. Termination or suspension may result in loss of access to Premium Features, subject to applicable law. Where required by law, we will provide access through the remainder of the paid billing period or another legally required remedy. You remain responsible for managing and canceling your Subscription through Apple.

21. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

21.1 Informal Resolution First

Before filing a claim, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute informally by emailing support@appside.io with a description of the issue and the relief you want. If we cannot resolve the dispute within 30 days, either party may pursue a claim as described below.

21.2 For U.S. Residents Only: Binding Individual Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

If you reside in the United States, you and we agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding individual arbitration and not in court, except as set out below. This section is governed by the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act.

(a) No class actions or representative proceedings
Disputes must be brought only in an individual capacity. You and we waive the right to participate in any class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding.

(b) Arbitration administrator and rules
Arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, unless the parties agree otherwise.

(c) Fees
Payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. We will pay AAA filing and arbitrator fees to the extent required for consumer arbitration under those rules, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous.

(d) Location and format
Arbitration will be conducted in English. It may take place by telephone, video, or written submissions. If an in-person hearing is required, it will take place in the U.S. county (or parish) where you reside, unless the arbitrator determines another location is appropriate.

(e) Arbitrator authority
The arbitrator may award the same individualized damages and relief that a court could award. The arbitrator may not award relief for anyone who is not a party to the arbitration.

(f) Exceptions: small claims and IP/equitable relief
Either party may bring an individual claim in small claims court if it qualifies. Either party may also seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect or enforce intellectual property rights.

(g) Time limit for U.S. arbitration claims
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any Dispute subject to arbitration must be filed within the time limits permitted by applicable law.

(h) Opt-out right
You may opt out of this arbitration agreement within 30 days of first accepting these Terms by emailing support@appside.io with: (i) your name, (ii) the Apple ID email used for your purchase (or another identifier we can reasonably use to locate your account, such as a transaction ID), and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of arbitration. For purposes of this Section 21.2, you first accept these Terms when you first install, access, or use the Services, whichever occurs first. Opting out will not affect any other parts of these Terms.

(i) Severability
If a court finds any part of this Section 21.2 unenforceable, the remainder will still apply. If the class action waiver is found unenforceable, then this Section 21.2 will be unenforceable only to the extent required by law.

21.3 For All Other Users: Governing Law and Courts

If you do not reside in the United States, these Terms are governed by the laws of Poland, without regard to conflict of laws principles. If you are a consumer, nothing in this Section 21.3 deprives you of mandatory protections of the laws of your country of residence, including any right to bring claims in the courts of that country where required by law. If you are not a consumer, disputes will be resolved exclusively by the competent courts in Poland.

22. Electronic Communications and Support

You consent to receive communications from us electronically (for example, in-app notices or email).

Support. You may contact us through our Support Channels, including support@appside.io. We are not obligated to provide support and any support is provided at our discretion. We do not guarantee response times. Support communications are not legal notices, except legal notices submitted in accordance with the Notices paragraph below.

Notices. We may provide notices to you through in-app messages or email, where appropriate. App Store listing updates may supplement notice but do not replace direct notice channels. If you need to send a formal legal notice to us, send it to support@appside.io. A notice is deemed received on actual receipt.

23. Intellectual Property Complaints

If you believe the Services infringe your intellectual property rights, you may contact us at support@appside.io for informal resolution, or you may send a formal notice immediately. We reserve all rights to investigate and enforce our intellectual property rights and these Terms. Send formal notices to support@appside.io with:

- your name and contact information
- a description of the work or right allegedly infringed
- where the allegedly infringing material appears in the Services
- a statement that you have a good faith belief the use is not authorized
- a statement that your notice is accurate and you are the rights owner or authorized to act for them

We may request additional information and may take appropriate action.
We may remove or restrict access to content or materials in the Services if we reasonably believe they may infringe rights or violate applicable law.

24. Apple App Store Terms (Required Notices)

- These Terms are between you and us, not Apple. Apple is not responsible for the Services or their content.
- To the extent permitted by law, Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance or support for the Application.
- Apple is not responsible for addressing claims by you or any third party relating to the Application, including product liability claims, claims that the Application fails to conform to legal requirements, and claims under consumer protection laws.
- If the Application fails to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple may refund the purchase price you paid for the Application (if any). To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the Application.
- In the event of any third-party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes intellectual property rights, Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, or discharge of such claim.
- You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
- You must comply with applicable third-party terms when using the Application.
- Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce these Terms against you.

- Severability. If any provision is held unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect.
- Entire Agreement. These Terms are the entire agreement regarding the Services and supersede prior agreements on the same subject.
- Assignment. You may not assign your rights under these Terms. We may assign our rights and obligations.
- No waiver. Failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.
- Force majeure. We are not liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond our reasonable control.
